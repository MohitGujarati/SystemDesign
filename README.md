# Uber Specific System Design
Project Overview
The objective of this project is to design and simulate a secure, scalable, and efficient network infrastructure for a company using Cisco Packet Tracer. The network will include essential components such as a database server, web server, file server, ERP server, and various Cisco networking devices to ensure optimal performance, security, and reliability.

This project will follow the Agile methodology with six distinct phases, aligning with a real-world approach to network design and implementation, similar to how Uber manages its global network infrastructure.

Inspiration from Uber's Network Infrastructure
Uber, as one of the world’s largest ride-sharing companies, operates a highly complex and scalable network that handles millions of requests per second. The company’s infrastructure is built to ensure:
- High Availability: Ensuring that services are always online with minimal downtime.
- Scalability: Efficiently handling rapid increases in user demand.
- Security: Protecting sensitive user data, financial transactions, and communication between services.

Key Components of Uber’s Network:
1. Microservices Architecture: Decomposing the system into independent services to enhance scalability and fault isolation.
2. Global Load Balancing: Using technologies like Cisco Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) to balance traffic across multiple data centers.
3. VPN and MPLS: Secure connectivity between data centers, offices, and cloud resources.
4. Data Centers: Utilizing on-premise data centers and cloud solutions for flexibility.
5. Automated Network Management: Leveraging Cisco’s software-defined networking (SDN) for dynamic configuration and management.

Drawing inspiration from Uber’s best practices, our network design will focus on scalability, performance, and security.
